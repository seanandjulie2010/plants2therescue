        <h2>About This Recipe</h2>
        <p>
          These chai-spiced vegan cupcakes are soft, tender, and naturally sweetened
          with dates &mdash; no oil, no refined sugar. The flavor comes from warm chai
          spices and strong brewed chai tea. Enjoy them plain, or top them with the
          optional chai cashew cream frosting for an extra-cozy treat.

        <h2>Quick Homemade Chai Tea</h2>
        <p>
          You can use your favorite chai tea bags, or make a quick version:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 black tea bags</li>
          <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
          <li>4–6 cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon grated or sliced fresh ginger (or a pinch of ground)</li>
          <li>2 whole cloves</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Add everything to a mug or small pot with 1&nbsp;½ cups hot water. Steep for
          about 10 minutes, then strain and cool. Measure 1 cup for the recipe.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Make the Cupcakes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>350°F (175°C)</strong>. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with parchment or silicone liners.</li>
          <li>
            Prepare the date paste if you haven’t already: soak the pitted dates in
            hot water for 10–15 minutes, then drain and blend with just enough fresh
            water to form a smooth, thick paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the oat flour, baking powder, baking soda,
            salt, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and allspice until well combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk the cooled chai tea, date paste, applesauce, and
            vanilla until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just
            combined. Avoid over-mixing; a few small lumps are okay.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide the batter evenly among the 12 cupcake liners. Tap the pan gently on
            the counter to release any air bubbles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for <strong>18–22 minutes</strong>, or until a toothpick inserted in the
            center of a cupcake comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the pan from the oven and let the cupcakes cool in the pan for
            5–10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before
            frosting.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Make the Chai Cashew Cream Frosting (Optional)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the soaked and drained cashews, 2 tablespoons chai tea, 2 tablespoons
            date paste, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla to a high-speed blender.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blend until completely smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides
            as needed. Add an extra splash of chai tea only if necessary to help it
            blend; you want a thick, spreadable frosting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste and adjust sweetness or spice, adding a little more date paste or
            cinnamon/cardamom if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes
            to firm up before piping or spreading on the cooled cupcakes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Serving &amp; Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Decorate some cupcakes with frosting and leave others plain, just like in
            the photo. Both versions are delicious.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a café-style look, dust the frosted cupcakes lightly with cinnamon and
            top with a single star anise (remove before eating).
          </li>
          <li>
            Store unfrosted cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for
            up to 2 days, or in the fridge for up to 5 days. Frosted cupcakes keep best
            covered in the fridge.
          </li>
          <li>
            These pair perfectly with a mug of warm chai or rooibos tea for a cozy,
            plant-powered treat.
          </li>
